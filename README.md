### My Changes:
* Overall:
    * Analog Clock
    * Digital Clock

* CSS:
    * played with hsl
    * middle button of hands did not align the same - had to tweak it


### What I Learned:
* Emmet shortcut:
    div.number.number$*12{$}*12
        = the div is class of number with class of incremented number for specified length (12) with the incremented number of specified length (12) in the between div space {}
    NOTE: My Emmet did not like the extra *12 on the end. When I removed it, it worked as expected.

* CSS: hsl = hue, saturation, lightness
    https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_colors_hsl.asp:
        Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
        Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
        Lightness is also a percentage. 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark, 100% is white
    orange favorite is hsl(20, 100%, 50%), hsl(40, 100%, 50%)
    purple favorite is hsl(258, 100%, 50%), hsl(248, 53%, 58%) 

* CSS: perfect circle
    border-radius: 50%;

* CSS: positioning
    * for child to be absolute, parent = relative
    * transform: translateX(-50%) -for an object to be moved backward 50% of its width
