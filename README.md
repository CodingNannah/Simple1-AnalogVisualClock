### My Changes:


### What I Learned:
Emmet shortcut:
    div.number.number$*12{$}*12
        = the div is class of number with class of incremented number for specified length (12) with the incremented number of specified length (12) in the between div space {}
    NOTE: My Emmet did not like the extra *12 on the end. When I removed it, it worked as expected.
